Lightweight cross-platform tool for correcting MinerU OCR texts

### Usage

Open the application and load the `_middle.json` file generated by MinerU OCR. The app will display the recognized text along with a textbox for editing. After making corrections, click on "Save", it will automatically save it in the same json file. It also adds hashes to each of the text spans for reference.
